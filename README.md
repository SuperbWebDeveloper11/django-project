daily-goals is a django project to allow you to write and keep track of your daily goals 
I use the 5 goals setting method, that's mean i enforce myself to have at most 5 goals for each (day, month, week and year), and they should be the most important
Some goals are important but i don't want to track them so i put them bellow thees 5 goals in a text area or i don't write them at all


### How I Fill My Goals

- I enter into the yearly_goals page
- I shoose the year and my 5 goals for that year

- I enter into the monthly_goals page
- I shoose the month and my 5 goals for that month

- I enter into the weekly_goals page
- I shoose the week and my 5 goals for that week

- I enter into the daily_goals page
- I shoose the day and my 5 goals for that day


### How I Display My Goals
- yearly_goals page display yearly goals in an html table
- monthly_goals page display monthly goals in an html table
- weekly_goals page display weekly goals in an html table
- daily_goals page display daily goals in an html table
